## Blarg

I code a lot. 

I code primarily for work and secondarily for pleasure. Often times those are reversed.

I code crazy ideas. I code solid, grounded ideas. I code new, "fresh" ideas. And often I find out there are 20 other projects that are 3 years old and do it better.

I code in python. I code in javascript. I code in java and ruby and bash and excel and in conversation and in _right tool for the right job_. But mainly I code in python.

I commit code. I delete _lots_ of code. At some point every project has a walk of shame. I delete more than I share.

Sometimes I code well. Sometimes I'm a damn dirty dev.

But the important thing is: I code.

```python
>>> class Person:
...    def __init__(self):
...       self.like_beer = True
...       self.am_conservative = False
...       self.code = True
...       self.am_a_father = True
...       self.love_my_wife = True
...       self.fail = "often and fast"
...       self.make_mistakes = "more often than not"
...       self.learn = "always"
...
>>> I = Person()
>>> I.code
True
>>>
```

## Blog

From time to time I feel possessed to write down something I've learned and share it with the world. 

One day this will happen. And it will happen here.
